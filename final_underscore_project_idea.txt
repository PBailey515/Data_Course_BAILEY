I want to make a pipeline that will allow me to sift through a sample of a oral microbiome to find
             specific species that are common in oral diseases, I want to use samples from the gingiva on HOMD, 
             i actually want to swab my own mouth and sequence my microbiome to see what bacteria is there then look for 
             those species, The data will be a metagenome, then i think i need to recognize certain sequences of the organisms i am looking for
             then search the huge excel sheet for those specific sequences
